		<h1>PWP Milestone 2a</h1>
		<h2>Content Strategy</h2>
		<p><strong>Header: </strong>My header will clearly state my name and my role as a web developer. The left side of my header will include page navigation links. The nav links will be collapsed into a "hamburger menu" for mobile, but  will be expanded for larger screens.</p>
		<p><strong>About Me: </strong>This section will describe my skillset, work history, personality. I want to use a personable/casual tone for this section.</p>
		<p><strong>Portfolio:</strong> this section will be an image gallery. The user can tap on one of the 3-6 categories represented by the circular photos to open up an image gallery where the user can then scan through a slideshow that has captions thtat describe the project.</p>
		<p><strong>Contact: </strong>This section contains a simple contact form where users can enter their name, email address and a message. The user will use the reCAPTCHA form before submitting their message.</p>
		<p><strong>Footer:</strong> Will contain links to my resum√©, and LinkedIn and GitHub accounts.</p>
		<h2>Wireframes</h2>
