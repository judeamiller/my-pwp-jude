# Milestone 1
## Specifications
Great job on Milestone1, you met all the specifications laid out in the documentation. Your HTML is standards compliant.  The directory structure matches what was outlined. Finally, the content is straightforward and I am able to identify what you want to accomplish and who is your target audience.
## Site Feedback
What you hope to accomplish with your PWP should be straight foreword and relatively easy to achieve. The hardest part will be making the site stream lined so that your ideal user can be able to make a snap decision about you in under four minutes.
### Grade Tier IV
*going foreword the use of inline styles will result in a steep penalty to your grade. In the future use an external style sheet(even if it is only a single line of CSS).*

# Milestone 2a
## Overall Feedback
Awesome job on Milestone2a. Directory structure, Html, and content are superb. This is the quality of work I would expect out of a jr developer working underneath me. I am a little disappointed in your git history. While you have a lot of commits the commit messages repeat them selfs and don't provide much detail.
### Wireframes
Your Wireframes are clear and easy to understand. With a quick glance I am able to tell what you hope to accomplish and have a clear vision of what your website will look like. The Mobile and Desktop wireframes match and are clearly of the same site(which should translate nicely bootstrap4).
### Content Strategy
The Content Strategy is clear and complements your wireframes nicely. I have a clear understanding of what you hope to accomplish.
## Design Tips
Your portfolio section is going to require third party plugins. You may be able to accomplish what you envision using only FancyBox3. However a combination of multiple third party plugins may be required(I recommend looking into (slick)[http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/]). I also recommend that you reach out to Elliot to see if he has any tips for for you.

## Moving Foreword
We'll be building PWP in a file named index.php inside of /public_html. Please note that no site files should live outside of the /public_html directory. Please use an organized and standards-compliant directory structure to house all images, JavaScript, CSS, etc. We are done with the /documentation directory from here out!
