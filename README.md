Deep Dive PWP project

## Specifications
Great job on Milestone1, you met all the specifications laid out in the documentation. Your HTML is standards compliant.  The directory structure matches what was outlined. Finally, the content is straightforward and I am able to identify what you want to accomplish and who is your target audience.
## Site Feedback
What you hope to accomplish with your PWP should be straight foreword and relatively easy to achieve. The hardest part will be making the site stream lined so that your ideal user can be able to make a snap decision about you in under four minutes.
### Grade Tier IV
*going foreword the use of inline styles will result in a steep penalty to your grade. In the future use an external style sheet(even if it is only a single line of CSS).*
